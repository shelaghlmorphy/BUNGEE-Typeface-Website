# BUNGEE-Typeface-Website
### By Shelagh Morphy
This Bungee Typeface provides an interactive introduction to the Bungee typeface, and allows users to create their own sign design using the font. Users are first directed to a welcome page, which displays the typeface in the style of a neon sign, and provides a brief description about the Bungee and credits its designer. The "continute to site" button will direct users to the home (or main) page of the website. This page consists of two panels: edit and display. In the edit panel, users can input their own unique text and hit "create!" to see that text displayed in the display panel on the left. From here, users have the option to edit the font style, color, orientation, and font size of their text!
